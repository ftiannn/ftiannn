# Hey, I'm FT Tan 

I'm a developer who stumbled into tech through game development.  
My first real project was a 3D game built in Unity — and later rebuilt in Unreal for my college final-year project.  
I still keep a clip of that game — it reminds me where I started. 🎮

Back then, I mostly used Java and C++, and never imagined I'd end up building full-stack web apps or tinkering with cloud infrastructure. But here I am — constantly learning, building, and enjoying the process.

## 💡 What I’ve built recently

### [Habitly](https://github.com/ftiannn/habitly)
A full-featured habit tracker built across web and mobile — created as a passion project during a career break.

- ✅ Web + Mobile support (React + Capacitor)
- ✅ Secure auth flow with JWT and Google OAuth
- ✅ Gamification: streaks, mood, quotes, celebrations
- ✅ Fully infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, AWS)
- ✅ CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Live: [app.myhabitly.com](https://app.myhabitly.com)  
- Docs: [api.myhabitly.com/docs](https://api.myhabitly.com/docs)

## ☕ A Bit More About Me

- 📍 Based in Singapore
- I love drawing — I make digital portraits for friends
- Into singing, coffee, travel planning, and thoughtful design
- I enjoy making things work and quietly iterating to make them better

I care about the little details and always ask:  
**“How can I make this better?”**

⚡ Fun facts
> I plan full itineraries for trips I haven’t even booked yet (hello, Yunnan and Vietnam 👋)
> I love ice cream — especially chocolate chip. Who says no to that?
> I hit the gym even though the gym hits me harder every time 🥲
